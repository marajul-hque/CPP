// 7. Write a program that asks you to enter an automobile gasoline consumption figure
// in the European style (liters per 100 kilometers) and converts to the U.S. style of
// miles per gallon. Note that in addition to using different units of measurement, the
// U.S.approach (distance / fuel) is the inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance). Note that 100 kilometers is 62.14 miles, and 1 gallon is 3.875 liters.Thus, 19
// mpg is about 12.4 l/100 km, and 27 mpg is about 8.7 l/100 km
